/**
 * A turn the owner starts by typing at this terminal (item 718825fc).
 *
 * When the owner types a prompt into their own connected Claude Code, the owner
 * asked for what the agent does in that turn, and DevSpec records them as the
 * requester of its writes. The server takes that from one source only: a turn the
 * HOST admitted with the connection's hidden capability, which the model never
 * holds (report_pickup with local_activity_version 1, server migrations 983 and
 * 1162). Busy heartbeats and posts declaring a local turn open turns too, but the
 * model can make those itself, so they never name anyone. Pi admits its terminal
 * turns the same way.
 *
 * The UserPromptSubmit hook admits the turn before the model starts, so it exists
 * before the first write. The poller's busy heartbeats keep its working lease alive
 * while the turn marker stands, background holds included. The Stop hook that
 * really ends the turn completes exactly this attempt.
