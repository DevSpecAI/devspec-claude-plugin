/**
 * devspec-remote-wait — wake the coding agent when a new OWNER COMMAND arrives
 * (CONNECTION-NATIVE, item fd51d80b).
 *
 * Complements continuous `devspec-remote-poll.mjs` (heartbeats + inbox writer).
 * This process does **not** heartbeat. It watches the per-connection inbox written
 * by the poller and **exits 0** when a new `owner_messages` line appears after the
 * saved byte offset — so:
 *   - Claude Code: run_in_background → process exit wakes the model
 *   - Grok Build:  monitor tool on this process stdout → chat notification
 *
 * It wakes ONLY on `owner_messages` (server-stamped owner commands / dispatches).
 * `advisory_context` inbox entries (teammate / Dev / other-agent room context) are
 * DELIBERATELY ignored as a WAKE TRIGGER — advisory must never force a model wake or
 * an autonomous response.
 *
 * It is NOT ignored as CONTENT. An `owner_messages` entry carries the room the
 * command arrived into on its `context` field (owner-ambient + everyone-else, carried
 * forward by the poller since the last command), and this script prints that block in
 * the SAME stdout payload as the command — labelled, ahead of it, so the command is
 * the last thing read. That is the mechanical fix for item 27058153: the model cannot
 * receive the command without also receiving the room, so understanding the room
 * stops depending on a skill instruction being followed. Before this, advisory lived
 * only in a side file and Claude Code failed a live "1, 2, 3 … what's next?" test
 * while holding all three messages on disk.
 *
 * After the agent acts, re-arm THIS wait process only (not the poller) — with
 * `--pending`, which resumes from the saved inbox offset AND leaves the working
 * indicator alone, because a re-arm happens mid-turn by design (see armEndsTurn).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node devspec-remote-wait.mjs --connection-id <uuid> [--from-end|--pending] [--owner-pid <pid>]
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  — one or more new owner_messages batches printed to stdout; agent should act
 *   1  — TERMINAL: remote disabled / connection ended in state / owner gone / error
 *   2  — bad args
 *   3  — NON-TERMINAL: this arm aged out with no owner mail. Re-arm; the connection
 *        is fine. Split out of exit 1 for item d655b2a4: both cases used to exit 1,
 *        and the skill's documented response to exit 1 is "stop", so a compliant
 *        agent tore down a perfectly live connection on a 24h rollover or a harness
 *        reap. Exit 1 is now strictly "a human or the server ended this".
 *
 * PROOF OF LIFE (item 8b4ceaa3). While armed, this process owns
 * `<connection>.wait.pid`, and removes it on every exit path. That file is what lets
 * anything else — specifically the Stop hook — tell "a listener is armed" from "this
 * connection is live but deaf". Before it existed, a missed re-arm was undetectable:
 * the poller kept heartbeating, the Agents page kept saying Live, the inbox kept
 * filling, and nothing anywhere knew nobody was reading.

 * the driver's UI showing nothing. **Turn end is owned by the Stop hook**
 * (`mirror-turn.mjs stop`), which every plugin registers, plus MAX_TURN_MS in the
 * poller as the backstop for a host whose Stop hook never fires.
 *
 * A first arm (`--from-end`) genuinely is idle: the agent is connecting or
 * reconnecting and deliberately discarding the historical inbox, so a marker left
 * by a seed delivery belongs to a turn nobody will ever wake for, and must be
 * cleared or the connection shows a phantom "working" until MAX_TURN_MS elapses.
 * That is the case the original unconditional clear was written for.
