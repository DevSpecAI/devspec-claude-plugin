# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## 0.4.1 - 2026-07-13

Marketplace-readiness pass.

- Aligned the version across `plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `package.json` (previously drifted).
- Added `displayName`, `homepage`, and `repository` to the plugin manifest.
- Rewrote the README: production MCP URL (`https://devspec.ai/api/mcp`), full command list with correct `/devspec-autopilot:<command>` namespacing, accurate project structure, and clearer Node.js prerequisites.

## 0.4.x - remote control

- Added `/devspec.remote` and `/devspec.remote-stop` for DevSpec Agents-page remote control.
- Conversation-scoped remote bonds; long-lived poller that keeps heartbeating through owner instructions.
- Mechanical turn mirroring via `Stop` / `UserPromptSubmit` hooks.

## 0.2.x - initial autopilot

- Autopilot polling loop: claim staged action items, implement in isolated worktrees, test, push/merge, and report back to DevSpec.
- Planning mode ("Request Agent Plan").
- Terminal companions: `/devspec.work`, `/devspec.create`, `/devspec.commit`, `/devspec.link`, `/devspec.done`, `/devspec.help`.
